About Proteus Tools
Proteus Tools is designed to streamline the journey from concept to working hardware. It unifies three critical streams:

- SPICE simulation: faithful circuit behavior, timing, and interaction with components.
- PCB design: schematic capture, layout, routing, and output generation suitable for fabrication.
- Firmware debugging and IoT development: visibility into firmware behavior, hardware-software co-design, and edge-device integration.

The goal is to reduce handoffs between tools, minimize context switching, and provide a single source of truth for your project. The project emphasizes clarity, reliability, and performance. It supports iterative design cycles, reproducible tests, and collaborative workflows. It also includes robust documentation, example projects, and a growing set of integrations to fit common hardware platforms.

Guiding principles
- Clarity over cleverness: simple, readable interfaces that align with real-world tasks.
- Stability over novelty: well-tested components that you can rely on for long-running projects.
- Modularity over monoliths: independent modules that can be used alone or together.
- Open collaboration over proprietary silos: transparent development, easy contribution paths, and clear issue handling.
- Reproducibility over guesswork: workflows that can be repeated and shared across teams.

Quick Start
This quick start guide helps you get Proteus Tools up and running quickly. It is written for readers who want to verify the core capabilities in a practical, hands-on way. The steps assume a standard development environment and common hardware. If you run into platform-specific quirks, the sections later in this document include deeper troubleshooting tips.

- Step 1: Locate the release bundle
  Proteus Tools makes available its builds through a releases channel. The latest releases are published at the official releases page. From that page you can download the installer or archive that matches your platform. The releases page is your entry point for trusted, signed binaries and verified packages.

- Step 2: Download the installer or archive
  On Windows, run the installer named proteus-tools-windows-installer.exe after download.
  On Linux, extract the tarball proteus-tools-linux-x86_64.tar.gz and run the included launcher.
  On macOS, install the package proteus-tools-darwin.pkg or use the provided zip if listed.
  If you are unsure which file to pick, the releases page lists platform-specific options and a concise description for each artifact.

- Step 3: Install and run
  Install follows a straightforward wizard for Windows and macOS. Linux users typically extract the archive and run the launcher from the command line or a desktop shortcut if provided. After installation, launch Proteus Tools and sign in if required by your workspace.

- Step 4: Create a first project
  Start a new project with a name that reflects your goal. A typical first project includes:
  - A schematic representing a simple circuit (LED, resistor, microcontroller, and power source).
  - A PCB layout that fits a standard prototyping board.
  - A basic firmware script that toggles a pin to drive the LED.

- Step 5: Run a simulated test
  Open the SPICE simulator, load the schematic, and run a time-domain analysis. Observe voltage, current, and timing signals. Adjust a few component values and re-run to verify that the circuit behaves as expected.

- Step 6: Move to PCB design
  After the schematic behaves as intended, proceed to the PCB editor. Place components on a board outline, route traces, and generate Gerber outputs for fabrication. You can simulate the board to ensure signal integrity before sending files to production.

- Step 7: Debug firmware in the same flow
  Connect your real device or use a virtual target to debug firmware. Step through code, inspect memory, and watch how hardware signals respond in real time. This integration makes it easier to identify mismatches between firmware and hardware behavior.

- Step 8: Extend with IoT features
  If your project involves IoT, configure network stacks, device provisioning, and cloud integration. Proteus Tools includes templates and helpers to simulate IoT devices and manage data flows securely.

- Step 9: Save and share
  Save your project to a repository location or share it with teammates. The tools provide reproducible project files, config snapshots, and a clean export path for archiving.

- Step 10: Explore deeper
  Beyond the quick-start exercises, there is a large library of examples, tutorials, and extensions. You can tailor workflows to your hardware, study data from tests, and automate repetitive tasks with the scripting interface.
